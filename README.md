# Coding exercise for Carousell.

Uses Sahat's hackathon-starter (https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter), which is awesome for hackathons, god bless his soul.

This app utilizes nodeJS, expressJS for routing, mongoDB for data storage and persistance, Pug for frontend (which I picked up through this project), and heroku for deployment.

# Starting the app
(Assumes you have npm, node, and mongoDB installed locally)
1) > mongod
2) > npm install
3) > npm start
